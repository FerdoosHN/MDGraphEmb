# **MDGraphEmb: A Toolkit for Encoding Molecular Dynamics Ensembles with Graph Embedding**

## **Motivation**  
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for investigating protein dynamics and function. Although significant advances have been made in integrating simulation techniques and machine learning, there are still challenges in selecting the most suitable data representation for learning. Graph embedding is a powerful computational method that automatically learns low-dimensional representations of nodes in a graph while preserving graph topology and node properties, thereby bridging graph structures and machine learning methods. Graph embeddings hold great potential for efficiently representing MD simulation data and studying protein dynamics.

## **Overview**  
We introduce MDGraphEmb, a Python library built on MDAnalysis, designed to facilitate the conversion of
protein conformation data into graph-based representations and graph embeddings. This enables the compression of large
noisy simulation trajectories into tabular formats suitable for machine learning. MDGraphEmb provides a framework
that supports a range of graph embedding techniques and machine learning models to create workflows to analyse protein
dynamics and identify important protein conformations. Graph embedding effectively captures and compresses structural
information from MD simulation data, making it applicable to diverse downstream machine-learning classification tasks.
An application is presented for encoding and detecting important protein conformations from molecular dynamics
simulations to classify functional states. Furthermore, a performance comparison of different graph embedding methods
in combination with machine learning models is reported.
